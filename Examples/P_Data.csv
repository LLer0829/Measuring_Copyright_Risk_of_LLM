She was a woman of the world, and a woman of fashion, and a woman of fortune. She had a large acquaintance, and she loved and valued the good opinion of the world. She naturally wanted her husband to assist her in the duties of hospitality, and in the return of those attentions which her situation in life rendered necessary. She naturally wanted him to dress, and act, and talk, and think with the men of his own rank. She naturally wanted him to place her, as far as it was in his power, in the situation to which she had been accustomed at her father’s house. She naturally wanted him to live with her in the country, and to make enough of his time to his profession to enable him to live with her in town. She naturally wanted him to think less about poetry and metaphysics, and more about the law and the weather. In short, she naturally wanted him to be as unlike himself as it was possible for him to be. It is not wonderful that she should have been disappointed. It is not wonderful that she should have been angry. It is not wonderful that she should have been jealous of a husband who was always absent, and of a sister who was always present. It is not wonderful that she should have been wearied by that eternal repetition of the old jokes, the old grumbling,{}",0.202247191,0,300

The following is the text of the letter : ""Madam,—I have received your letter of the 10th inst., and I am sorry to find that you have not been able to make up your mind to accept the terms which I offered you. I am not surprised at this, because I have always found you a very obstinate woman. I am, however, surprised at your having the face to propose to me to give you £300 a year, which you say is your income from the Funds. It is very well known that the dividends which ought to be paid to the proprietors of the stock have been embezzled to support the corrupt electioneering system of the Whigs. The proprietors have a right to the dividends, and it is my intention to pay them. I have, therefore, to inform you that I shall not pay you a farthing of the £300 a year which you say you have been in the habit of receiving. I shall send you a cheque for £50. Perhaps that will be enough to take you back to America. ""I am, Madam, your obedient servant, ""JOHN WILSON CROKER.""

The play is a study in drab, and the drabness is the point of it.  The two young men are the sons of the two old men. They are both in love with the same girl, and the girl is in love with one of them. The girl is a very pretty girl, and she is dressed in the prettiest of pretty frocks.

[Sidenote: _The “Sonnets.”_]  The “Sonnets” are, of course, the most important of the poems, and the most important of the “Sonnets” are those which are supposed to have been written to the “dark lady.” The first seventeen are, as has been said, a sort of prelude, and the next twenty-seven are a sort of interlude, to the main series, which begins with the 28th and ends with the 126th. The first seventeen are addressed to a young man, and are of the nature of a warning against marriage, or at least against marriage with a particular lady, who is not named, but who is supposed to be the same as the “dark lady” of the later series. The twenty-seventh is a sort of epilogue to these, and the twenty-eighth begins the main series. The first twenty-six of these are addressed to the “dark lady,” and the last twenty-seven to the young man, who is supposed to be the same as the young man of the first seventeen. The first twenty-six are, in the main, passionate love-poems, though the passion is not of the most refined kind, and the last twenty-seven are{}",0.193370166,0,300

The first edition of Mansfield Park was published in 1814, and the second in 1816. The novel was not a success. The author's brother Henry wrote to her in 1814 : ""I have received one or two hints from the public of a nature to alarm me, and which I ought to mention, though I think I may have represented them as unfounded. It is that the author of Pride and Prejudice has been too much over-rated. I do not think that it has been rated at all beyond its merits ; but I am inclined to think that it has, and that the superiority of the first work is no longer remembered."" The novel was not a success, and the reason is not far to seek. The author had not yet learned to make her characters interesting. The heroine is a prig, and the hero is a prig. The other characters are not much better. The author's own family did not like the book.

There is no attempt at the hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the","hands of a lesser artist would have been the inevitable result of such a situation. The whole thing is done with a simplicity and directness which are the very essence of good art.  The same may be said of the _Susanna_, which is a masterpiece of composition. The three figures are grouped with a skill which is only equalled by the skill with which the artist has made the most of the opportunity for the display of his powers as a colourist.

I think, however, though the","novelist may not be able to do this, that he may so tell his story that the reader shall see the characters as they are, and not as they are represented by a third person.  The novelist has also the advantage of space. He can tell his story at length, and need not be driven to omit those little touches which are so necessary to the rounding of his characters. He can also tell his story as he pleases, and need not be driven to that monotonous system of narrative which is imposed upon the dramatist. He can go backwards and forwards, and can make his personages tell their own tales without violating the unities. He can also give the results of conversation without violating the unities. He can make his personages converse without violating the unities. He can make his personages converse without bringing them together. He can bring before the reader the thoughts, the aspirations, the loves, the hatreds, the motives, and the ambition of men and women; but the dramatist can rarely do more than this--he can rarely do as much.  The novelist has also the advantage of that mystery which is so dear to mankind. He can so tell his story that the reader shall not know what is coming, and shall be compelled to buy the third volume in order that he may ascertain who was the murderer of{}",0.14893617,0,300

But it is not difficult to see that it is essentially the humour of a woman, and of a woman whose womanhood is of a very lofty type. It is the humour of one who sees all the little weaknesses and follies of human nature, and can enjoy a hearty laugh over them, and yet with a laugh in which there is no bitterness, and with a enjoyment in which there is no cynicism. It is the humour of one who loves her kind, and yet is not blind to its imperfections. It is the humour which delights in the ludicrous, which is always on the watch for the incongruous, which is quick to seize the comical aspects of things, and yet which never allows its mirth to degenerate into scorn or contempt. It is the humour of one who is essentially a gentlewoman, and who, while she can see the ridiculous side of things, can never see anything that is really mean or base. It is the humour of one who is essentially a woman, and who, while she can see the follies of her sex, can never see anything that is really unworthy in them.
